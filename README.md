# horiseon-website

This Horiseon landing page is a client info page that allows businesses to share the details of the product they are selling. 

Used for Horiseon Social Solution Services as part of the tools used in a sales pitch. Jump to product details from the navigation at the top of the page. Include additional selling points on the aside. 95% accessibility score and 100% SEO score.

## Motivation

* Horiseon Social Solution Services requested a landing page that met accessibility standards and would assist them in their sales pitches for future partnerships. 

## Problems Solved

* All <div> HTML elements have been replaced to flow in correct semantic HTML, increasing accessibility.

* Add alt tags to images that were missing them.

* Cleaned up the style.css sheet by optimalizing classes/id's with their associated HTML elements and combined several stylings to shorten the overall length of the styling sheet.

* Fixed a broken navigation button.

* All fixes done without changing the overall loko of the page.

## Lessons Learned

* How to build a really solid HTML starter code that I now feel I can build from scratch.

* How to properly use classes and id's to assist in making the style sheet concise, and not repetitive.

* Markdown sheet semantics.

## Features

1. Navigation jumps down to their respective sections on the page.
2. Informative aside bar for bringing the sales pitch home.
